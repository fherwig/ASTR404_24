# Time-dependent stellar evolution

## Time scales

### Free-fall time 

The time scale on which a self-gravitating system (e.g., a cloud of interstellar gas or a star) would collapse under its own gravity in the absence of any internal pressure or opposing forces. Star reacts on this time scale if you switch off the pressure support.
$$
t_\mathrm{ff} \approx \sqrt{\frac{1}{3G\rho}}
$$

### Kelvin-Helmholtz or thermal time scale

Time scale on which energy content escapes for a given luminosity. Star reacts on this time scale if you switch off the source of energy (nuclear burning).
$$
t_\mathrm{th} \approx \frac{E_\mathrm{int}}{L}
$$
Where $E$ is the internal energy of the system and $L$ is the luminosity.

### Nuclear time scale

Time scale on which star consumes nuclear fuel, e.g. for the sun the main-sequence life time.
