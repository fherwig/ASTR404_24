# Assigned Reading

For class | Reading
----------|--------------
Friday Jan 12  | Clarke & Carswell: Section 1 to the end of section 1.3
Tuesday Jan 16 | Clarke & Carswell section 3.5 and 3.6 (only 3.5 pages!)
Friday Jan 19 | BÃ¶hm-Vitense Vol 2 Chapter 7.1 and Vol 3 Chapter 4.1 

#### Tuesday Jan 23

* Kippenhahn & Weigert chapter 2.1 reviews again the 1D momentum equation, this is essentially review
* Kippenhahn & Weigert chapter 2.2 explains the general concept of integrating the structure equation and the required relation between $\rho$ and $P$
* Kippenhahn & Weigert chapter 2.3 provides an example how to estimate the central temperature and pressure of a star given its mass and radius

Hint: It is very helpful to remember the stellar structure equations in terms of $dm/dr$ and $dP/dr$ which is easiest if one completely understands what each term means.

#### For the quiz on Tuesday Jan 30 note the following
* From now on you are allowed to use your University-approved calculator. Still, I am not interested in answers more precise than 2 significant digits. So don't waste time with too much precision but round generously.
* For the Tuesday quiz know
    - how to calculate the mean molecular weight for a mix of a few elements that may be partially ionized
    - remind yourself what the scaling relation between T and M/R is, either from the virial theorem or from the combination of ideal gas and hydro-static equilibrium
* not for the quiz but for homework 1 coming soon: review `/user/scratch14_outreach/ASTR404_W24/notebooks/Star_explore_MESA.ipynb` (make a copy); this notebook can also in this repo in the notebooks folder
