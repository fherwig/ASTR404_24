## Tuesday Jan 23

* Kippenhahn & Weigert chapter 2.1 reviews again the 1D momentum equation, this is essentially review
* Kippenhahn & Weigert chapter 2.2 explains the general concept of integrating the structure equation and the required relation between $\rho$ and $P$
* Kippenhahn & Weigert chapter 2.3 provides an example how to estimate the central temperature and pressure of a star given its mass and radius

Hint: It is very helpful to remember the stellar structure equations in terms of $dm/dr$ and $dP/dr$ which is easiest if one completely understands what each term means.
