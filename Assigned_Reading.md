# Assigned Reading

For class | Reading
----------|--------------
Friday Jan 12  | Clarke & Carswell: Section 1 to the end of section 1.3
Tuesday Jan 16 | Clarke & Carswell section 3.5 and 3.6 (only 3.5 pages!)
Friday Jan 19 | Böhm-Vitense Vol 2 Chapter 7.1 and Vol 3 Chapter 4.1 

#### Tuesday Jan 23

* Kippenhahn & Weigert chapter 2.1 reviews again the 1D momentum equation, this is essentially review
* Kippenhahn & Weigert chapter 2.2 explains the general concept of integrating the structure equation and the required relation between $\rho$ and $P$
* Kippenhahn & Weigert chapter 2.3 provides an example how to estimate the central temperature and pressure of a star given its mass and radius

Hint: It is very helpful to remember the stellar structure equations in terms of $dm/dr$ and $dP/dr$ which is easiest if one completely understands what each term means.

#### For the quiz on Tuesday Jan 30 note the following
* From now on you are allowed to use your University-approved calculator. Still, I am not interested in answers more precise than 2 significant digits. So don't waste time with too much precision but round generously.
* For the Tuesday quiz know
    - how to calculate the mean molecular weight for a mix of a few elements that may be partially ionized
    - remind yourself what the scaling relation between T and M/R is, either from the virial theorem or from the combination of ideal gas and hydro-static equilibrium
* Not for the quiz but for homework 1 coming soon: review `/user/scratch14_outreach/ASTR404_W24/notebooks/Star_explore_MESA.ipynb` (make a copy); this notebook is also in this repo in the notebooks folder


#### For Friday Feb 2
Reading for Friday is about the main nuclear burning stages: H burning, He burning, C, Ne, O and Si burning. A reasonably short account is given for each burning stage in the textbook by Maeder which is in our Resources file and available online. Read the following sections and be prepared to summarize each burning stage and its key reactions briefly, verbally. You do not need to memorize any of the $\epsilon$ energy generation formulae but you may want to look for the temperature dependence (exponents) and how they are different for different burning stages. These temperature exponents express how sensitive the nuclear energy generation rate is to changes in the temperature. 
* 25.1.1 The pp Chains
* 25.1.3 The CNO Cycles
* 26.1 Helium Burning
* 28.1 Nuclear Reactions in the Advanced Phases
* 28.2.1 Toward the “Onion Skin” Model



#### For Tuesday Feb 6 
For this week's quiz there is no new reading, but as said in class, study the movie in the notes (found stand alone in the Notebooks_Movies directory) and identify burning stages in that movies based on what you learned about the fuel and ashes of the different burning products. In the quiz I will give you one of the frames and ask you what burning stages are active, and where.
