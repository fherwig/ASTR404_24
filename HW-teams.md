# Homework information

## General info

This is a team homework. Your team of 2 or three students is different for each HW. See below for team compositions for each HW.

Rename the homework notebook to `HWn_teamk.ipynb` where `n` is the HW number and 'k' is the team number. 

All problems should be answered in this notebook, see `ASTR404_24/4.Stellar_evolution_models_Astrohub.md`. Upload the notebook into your Outreach Hub session and save in the "username_config" directory. Once completed just leave them in that directory and I will grab it out of there myself. 

There will be **one** answer notebook per team. However, each team member must have the team answer notebook in their "username_config" and I will copy one team notebook from one team member. If a team member has no answer notebook they will get zero points for that HW. 

Please go to this [OneDrive Excel sheet](https://uvic-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/fherwig_uvic_ca/ERmUVw8TZltKssJnrOhxjtsBMxl-Dea-SeKxn5CiGib81A?e=7DoaPw) (needs uvic netlink login) and enter your GitHub user name. Please do so asap and let me know if you have problems with this. I need this info to grab the notebooks out of your config dir. 

There are due dates posted in the Syllabus and at the head of each HW. These are always at **9pm**. I will copy the notebooks at that time and any changes made after that are ignored.
