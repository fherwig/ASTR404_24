    "1. Consider the $20\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$, $Z=0.01$ NuGrid stellar model. Make a Hertzsprung-Russel diagram and a Kippenhahn diagram as well as a $\\rho_\\mathrm{c}$ - $T_\\mathrm{c}$ diagram. Mark on all three diagrams the location of the start of H, He, C and O burning. \n",
    "2. In the MESA profile data you find the variable `velocity` in units of `cm/s`, which is the radial velocity due to an acceleration that results from an imbalance in the momentum equation. Investigate the evolution of this radial velocity in what will end up as the Fe core as the star evolves towards the supernova explosion. Describe the conditions in the core near the very end of the computed model sequence. What is the maximum inward velocity? A good model sequence to consider are models 1N100 where N $\\in[2,3,4 \\dots 9]$.\n",
    "4. Find all isotopes that have mass fractions larger than $0.01$ at mass coordinate $0.5\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$  and $1.83\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$ at model `19100`. Confirm your finding by creating a `pt.abu_chart` plot which is available from a nugridse.se instance. \n",
    "5. Make abundance plots for the model `19100` including the five most abundance species at mass coordinate $0.5\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$ and the 10 most abundant species at  $1.83\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$. Describe the abundance profiles around mass coordinate $1.83\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$ and correlate it with the velocity plot at the same model. Interpret your finding. \n",
    "6. The mass coordinate $1.83\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$ is the final remnant mass according to the _rapid_ explosion model desribed in Pignatari etal (2016, ApJS 225:24), see table 8. The _delayed_ model assumes more accretion before explosion and therefore a larger remnant mass of  $2.73\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$. Calculate for both remnant masses the binding energy of the ejected material and express your answer in `foe` ($10^{51}\\mathrm{erg}$). Perform this calculation by using the structure profiles available from the NuGrid data. Perform the calculation as well in an approximate way similar to how we did it in the quiz. Compare your results.  "
